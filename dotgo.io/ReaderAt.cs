    ///  ReaderAt is the interface that wraps the basic ReadAt method.
    ///  ReadAt reads len(p) bytes into p starting at offset off in the underlying input source.
    ///  It returns the number of bytes read (0 <= n <= len(p)) and any error encountered.
    ///  When ReadAt returns n<len(p), it returns a non-nil error explaining why more bytes were not returned.
    ///  In this respect, ReadAt is stricter than Read.
    ///  Even if ReadAt returns n<len(p), it may use all of p as scratch space during the call.
    ///  If some data is available but not len(p) bytes, ReadAt blocks until either all the data is available or an error occurs.
    ///  In this respect ReadAt is different from Read.
    ///  If the n = len(p) bytes returned by ReadAt are at the end of the input source,
    ///  ReadAt may return either err == EOF or err == nil.
    ///  If ReadAt is reading from an input source with a seek offset, ReadAt should not affect nor
    ///  be affected by the underlying seek offset.
    ///  Clients of ReadAt can execute parallel ReadAt calls on the same input source.
    ///  Implementations must not retain p.
